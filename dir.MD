# File Management Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise will help you practice basic file and directory management in a Linux environment. You will create a complex directory structure, add files to it, and perform operations like copying, moving, and removing files and directories.

## Instructions

1. **Create a Root Directory**: Start by creating a root directory for your exercise. Open the terminal, navigate to your home directory, and create a directory called "FileManagementExercise" using the `mkdir` command.

2. **Navigate to the Root Directory**: Use the `cd` command to enter the "FileManagementExercise" directory.

3. **Create Subdirectories**: Within the root directory, create at least 15 subdirectories. You can name them creatively, such as "Dir1", "Dir2", and so on, using the `mkdir` command.

4. **Navigate to a Subdirectory**: Enter one of the subdirectories using the `cd` command.

5. **Create Files**: Inside the subdirectory, create at least 10 empty files. You can name them "File1.txt," "File2.txt," and so on, using the `touch` command.

6. **Return to the Root Directory**: Use `cd ..` to return to the root directory.

7. **Copy Files**: Copy a file from one subdirectory to another using the `cp` command. For example, copy "File1.txt" from "Dir1" to "Dir2."

8. **Move Files**: Move a different file from one subdirectory to another using the `mv` command. For example, move "File2.txt" from "Dir3" to "Dir4."

9. **Remove Files**: Remove a file from one of the subdirectories using the `rm` command. For example, remove "File3.txt" from "Dir5."

10. **Copy Directories**: Copy a whole directory (including its contents) to another location using the `cp -r` command. For example, copy "Dir6" to "Dir7."

11. **Move Directories**: Move a different directory to another location using the `mv` command. For example, move "Dir8" to "Dir9."

12. **Remove Directories**: Remove one of the subdirectories and its contents using the `rm -r` command. For example, remove "Dir10" and everything within it.

13. **List Contents**: Use the `ls` and `ls -R` commands to list the contents of the root directory and its subdirectories to verify your operations.

14. **Repeat Operations**: Repeat steps 7-12 with different files and directories until you've performed these file management operations at least five times.

15. **Exit**: Finally, exit the terminal when you are finished practicing by typing `exit` or pressing Ctrl+D.
